## Blocker Severity Guide

**Critical**: Blocks multiple agents or entire project progress  
Example: Database server won't start, prevents all other work

**High**: Blocks one agent's critical task  
Example: Can't generate Prisma schema due to syntax error

**Medium**: Blocks non-critical task or has workaround  
Example: Component library missing specific icon

**Low**: Nice-to-have or can work around easily  
Example: Documentation typo

## Escalation Path

1. **Report blocker here immediately**
2. **Tag relevant agent(s)** - mention in status file
3. **Chief of Staff** reviews blockers.md daily, escalates if needed
4. **Orchestration Agent** reviews weekly for strategic blockers
